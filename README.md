# Et-AppChase-Users-by-Role
This WordPress plugin adds a back-end Users by Role menu item, which is meant to replace the Users menu, and shows separate pages of users that are pre-filtered by their roles.  This is useful if you are particularly mindful of the different users' roles.

# Installation
* Follow normal wordpress plugin installation
* Edit the main file to specify which roles should see the settings menu and see the Users by Role admin menu
* Go to the Users by Role Settings page to specify which roles should be totally ignored. 'Administrator' would be a good choice.


# Status
This works.
